Assignment instructions:
Due date: Monday Feb 23rd (before class begins)
Create a new Repo (on Github.com)
name the repo: yourfirstname_vcc_1 (mikey_vcc_1) it's case sensitive!
set yourself as owner
add a description (it can be basic)
make sure it is public (which is the default already)
add a readme.md file (this is just a toggle switch, turn it on!)
add a .gitignore (choose whatever you like)
add a liscense file (again your choice, MIT is fine)
click the 'create' button
Clone it (remember to cd into that dir!) this will be done in the VS Code terminal
add 5 files (I would use the touch command) such as .txt file .css .html (any type of text or code)
make sure they are staged! (with an add???)
commit the files (with a push) always best to confirm you push (check Github.com) commit count on Github.com will be 2
modify 1 of the files and do another commit
push again
repeat 3 times
the total commit count will be at least 5!
run these two commands in your terminal:
git log --oneline
git remote -v
take a screenshot of the output (cmd + shift + 3)
save this screenshot as terminal
